# errorgeopy
Python geocoding in a disagreeing world

Wraps [geopy](https://github.com/geopy/geopy) geocoding to expose a simple way to use multiple providers of geocoding services simultaneously (with `multiprocessing`), and provide a report of the ensuing spatial uncertainty in the final location.

0. Configure your desired/allowed geocoding providers (`config.yml`).
1. Geocode an address using the errorgeopy `geocode` wrapper.
2. Recieve a multipoint of the geocoded address locations, the [convex hull](http://scipy.github.io/devdocs/generated/scipy.spatial.ConvexHull.html) of the result locations, the [concave hull](http://blog.thehumangeo.com/2014/05/12/drawing-boundaries-in-python/) of the results, various types of centroid, and quantitative measures of spatial agreement across component providers---as well as maintaining access to the original results.

# Installation

Requires Python 3; only tested with Python 3.5.

`pip install errorgeopy`

## Dependencies

- `geopy`
- `shapely` (outputs generally are `shapely.geometry` types in geographic coordinates)
- `sklearn`
- `scipy`

# Why?

Geocoding is very hard, although consumer-grade APIs make the process seem very easy. Intuitively, it does seem easy: address goes in, point comes out. [That's what Osaka Seafood Concern is all about. Every truckload of addresses you geocode brings you 31 cents closer to those tickets home!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIosb69x9iI)

But what if two different geocoding services both claim a successful address-level match, but the output location is different? If it is a subtle difference, it probably doesn't matter, especially if both addresses are within the same parcel. If it is a significant difference, it is possible that the two services have identified an ambiguity in the input address, or that one of them is just wrong, or that one of them can only match down to the suburb, and not the street or numberered address. Using more services may help you identify such a situtation and ignore such "minority opinions". **This is exactly what errorgeopy can do for you.**

For example, given a configuration (not shown) for making requests to multiple geocoding services, errorgeopy can return identified clusters of addresses, in order, with the first cluster being the largest (and therefore most likely positive match):

```python
>>> import os, yaml
>>> from errorgeopy.geocoders import GeocoderPool
>>> # Get geocoder configuration from a file
>>> config = './configuration.yml'
>>> g_pool = GeocoderPool.fromfile(config, yaml.load)
>>> test = '66 Great North Road, Grey Lynn, Auckland, New Zealand'
>>> location = g_pool.geocode(test)
>>> print(location.clusters)
{
  0: {
    'centre': 'POINT (174.7445831298828 -36.8640251159668)',
    'members': [
      (174.7375733, -36.8654),
      (174.74137, -36.86642),
      (174.75116408200063, -36.86094807899963)
    ]
  },
  1: {
    'centre': 'POINT (174.7426300048828 -36.86511993408203)',
    'members': [
      (174.7511328, -36.8610372),
      (174.7402083, -36.8668223),
      (174.7428788, -36.8659204)
    ]
  }
}
```

<!-- TODO find a better example -->

In the above, we have two identified clusters:
- The first (`0`) centrered at `POINT (174.7445831298828 -36.8640251159668)`, and another (`1`) centered at `POINT (174.7426300048828 -36.86511993408203)`. In this case they have an equal number of members, so the ambiguity unfortunately isn't well resolved, but at least now you have two smaller clusters you can use, rather than being left with a larger area of ambiguous addresses.

There are also methods to return a complete mutlipoint geometry, a convex hull, and a concave hull of the result set.

# Contributing and/or developing

Any pull requests, issues and comments are welcome. If you want to experiment with errorgeopy with any edits you may make to it, you can install development versions of errorgeopy from the source with, for example:

```sh
virtualenv -p python3 envname # Make a virtualenv with Python 3
python setup.py sdist # Make a distribution
pip install errorgeopy --no-index --find-links file:///path/to/errorgeopy/dist/errorgeopy-X-X-X.tar.gz # Install version X-X-X from the archive you just made
```

Inside `./demo` there is a Flask application that uses the environment's installed version of errorgeopy for running a demonstration.
