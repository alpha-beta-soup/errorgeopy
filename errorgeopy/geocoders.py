"""Contains the `Geocoder` and `GeocoderPool` classes, representing one, and a
pool of pre-configured geocoders, respectively.

`Geocoder` is a very thin piece
of wrapping over `geopy.geocoders.base.Geocoder` that primarily just initialises
a `geopy.geocoders.Geocoder` instance by referring to it by name and passing
configuration.

`GeocoderPool` coordinates reading of configuration (file or dictionary) of a
suite of geocoders that you should configure, although a small number are
available with no configuration. The `GeoCoder` pool then coordinates requests
via individual `Geocoder` objects, handling failures and geocoding in parallel
for the sake of efficiency. Both forward and backward ("reverse") geocoding is
supported, but note that not all geocoding services exposed via `errorgeopy`
support both methods.
